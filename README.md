# playcanvas-typescript-template

Minimal setup to set up a local PlayCanvas development using TypeScript.

This works with my other [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) plugin [parcel-plugin-playcanvas](https://github.com/hxhieu/parcel-plugin-playcanvas) for a seamless local <-> PlayCanvas Editor workflow.

# How to use
- Clone this repo
- `npm install` or `yarn install` to pull the dependencies
- `npm run serve` or `yarn serve` for development, `.ts` files are watched and rebundle and upload to PlayCanvas automatically
- `npm build` for a production build
